            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Owen Pace, a passionate student exploring the world
             of web development and technology. I enjoy learning new programming languages and
              building creative solutions to real-world problems. When I'm not coding, I love 
              staying curious and discovering innovative ways to apply technology in everyday 
              life.</p>

            <h2>Latest Project</h2>
            <p>I created this project due to a real problem I saw among traders.
                 MetaTrader5 is an extremely popular and commonly used platform among 
                 traders that provides accurate backtesting and some analytics, but what 
                 most traders fail to realize is that passing a backtest simply is not sufficient 
                 enough to verify a valid strategy. What many fail to realize is that often 
                 strategies are overfitted or pass a backtest by pure luck. Institutions and hedge
                  funds know this and perform a number of other tests to determine a viable 
                  strategy. I aim to help provide SOME of these institutional level tests for 
                  free. This is where analyticclarity.com comes in. Note: This could also work for 
                  custom python stratergy setups provided your documented trades match the same 
                  format as mt5.</p>
